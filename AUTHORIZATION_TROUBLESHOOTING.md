# User Not Authorized - Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Firestore Rules Update
Fixed authorization issue in conversations/messaging rules:

**Before** (Incorrect):
```javascript
match /conversations/{conversationId} {
  allow read: if request.auth.uid in resource.data.participants;  // ❌ Wrong field name
}
```

**After** (Correct):
```javascript
match /conversations/{conversationId} {
  allow read: if request.auth.uid in resource.data.participantIds;  // ✅ Correct field
}
```

**Status**: ✅ **Rules deployed successfully**

## 🔐 Authorization Error Causes & Solutions

### Error 1: "User Not Authorized" on Messages/Messaging

**Cause**: User not authenticated or rules deny access  
**Solution**:
- ✅ Make sure you're logged in (check Profile tab)
- ✅ Log out and log back in to refresh auth token
- ✅ Check internet connection is active
- ✅ Rules just deployed - restart app to clear cache

```bash
# Restart app to reload rules
adb shell pm clear org.starpage.app
adb shell am start -n org.starpage.app/.MainActivity
```

### Error 2: "Permission Denied" in Firestore Operations

**Cause**: User lacks permission for specific operation  
**Solution Check**:

| Feature | Rule | Fix |
|---------|------|-----|
| **View Profile** | Public read | No login needed |
| **Create Post** | Needs authentication | Must be logged in |
| **Comment** | Needs authentication | Must be logged in |
| **Message** | Must be conversation participant | Start conversation first |
| **Edit Post** | Must be author | You must own the post |

### Error 3: "Access Denied" on Cloud Storage

**Cause**: Storage upload/download permission denied  
**Solution**:
- ✅ Check Cloud Storage rules are deployed:
```bash
firebase deploy --only storage:rules
```
- ✅ Verify file path matches rules pattern:
  - Profile: `profile_images/{userId}.jpg`
  - Posts: `posts/{userId}/{postId}/*`
- ✅ Check user authentication token is valid

### Error 4: "Operation Not Permitted" on Database

**Cause**: Firestore rules prevent operation  
**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify rules are correct
firebase firestore:indexes

# Redeploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## 🔧 Current Authorization Rules (Now Fixed)

### Users Collection
```javascript
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read: if true;  // Anyone can view profiles
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;  // Only owner can edit
}
```

### Posts Collection
```javascript
match /posts/{postId} {
  allow read: if true;  // Anyone can read posts
  allow create: if request.auth != null;  // Any authenticated user
  allow update: if request.auth != null && resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid;  // Author only
  allow delete: if request.auth != null && resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid;  // Author only
}
```

### Comments Collection
```javascript
match /comments/{commentId} {
  allow read: if true;  // Anyone can read
  allow create: if request.auth != null;  // Any authenticated user
  allow update: if request.auth != null && resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid;  // Author only
  allow delete: if request.auth != null && resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid;  // Author only
}
```

### Conversations Collection ✅ FIXED
```javascript
match /conversations/{conversationId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                 (request.auth.uid in resource.data.participantIds);  // ✅ Conversation participants only
  allow create: if request.auth != null;  // Any authenticated user
  allow update: if request.auth != null && 
                   (request.auth.uid in resource.data.participantIds);  // Participants only
}
```

### Messages Collection (Sub-collection)
```javascript
match /messages/{messageId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                 (request.auth.uid in get(...).data.participantIds);  // Participants only
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
                   request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.senderId;  // Sender must be auth user
}
```

## 🐛 Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Authentication
```bash
# Get current user
# Go to Profile tab in app
# Should show your name and email

# If not logged in:
# 1. Go to Login screen
# 2. Enter email and password
# 3. Should authenticate successfully
```

### Step 2: Check Firestore Rules
```bash
# View current rules
firebase firestore:indexes

# View rule file
cat firestore.rules

# Redeploy if needed
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Step 3: Check Firebase Project
```bash
# Verify correct project
firebase projects:list

# Should show: starpage-ed409

# If not, set project
firebase use starpage-ed409
```

### Step 4: Monitor Real-time Logs
```bash
# Watch app logs during operation
adb logcat org.starpage.app:V *:S

# Look for Firestore errors like:
# - "Permission denied"
# - "PERMISSION_DENIED"
# - "Unauthorized"
```

### Step 5: Clear and Rebuild
```bash
# Clear all caches
flutter clean
adb shell pm clear org.starpage.app

# Rebuild
flutter build apk --release

# Reinstall
adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

## 📊 Authorization Flow (What Happens)

```
User performs action (e.g., send message)
    ↓
[1] Check: Is user authenticated?
    request.auth != null
    ↓
[2] Check: Does user meet rule conditions?
    request.auth.uid == resource owner OR
    request.auth.uid in participants[] OR
    other rule conditions
    ↓
[3] Result: Allow or Deny
    ✅ Operation succeeds
    ❌ Operation fails with "Not Authorized"
```

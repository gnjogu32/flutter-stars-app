2. **Check Firebase Console**: 
   - Firestore → Rules compiled?
   - Storage → Rules deployed?
   - Authentication → Can sign in?
3. **Try on different device**: Isolate if device-specific
4. **Clear app cache**: `adb shell pm clear org.starpage.app`
5. **Rebuild app**: `flutter clean && flutter build apk --release`
